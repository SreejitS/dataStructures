INTRODUCTION
- Programs are basically instructions that perform operations on data. Organisation of data in the main memory during execution
time of a program is data structure.
- Array, matrices and linked list are called physical data structure ie they define how the data is arranged in the memory.
Stack,queue,trees,graph,hashing are logical data structure ie how data is utilised.
- Most of the data structure implementation are in recursion due the mathematical nature of CS. As this is inefficient in systems, they are converted to loops.
